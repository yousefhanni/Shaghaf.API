## Generic Repository and Unit of Work

Shaghaf API utilizes the Generic Repository pattern and the Unit of Work pattern to manage data access operations consistently and efficiently across different entities.

- **Generic Repository**: A reusable repository pattern that provides a consistent interface for CRUD operations. The `GenericRepository` class implements common data access operations, ensuring that all repositories adhere to the same standard and reducing code duplication.

- **Unit of Work**: The `UnitOfWork` pattern manages transactions across multiple repository operations, ensuring consistency and integrity. This pattern is crucial in scenarios where multiple changes need to be committed to the database as a single atomic operation, thereby preventing partial updates and maintaining data consistency.

The following specific repositories are implemented within the Shaghaf API:

- **BookingRepository**: Manages data access for booking-related entities.
- **CartRepository**: Handles CRUD operations for cart items, particularly leveraging Redis for efficient in-memory data storage.
